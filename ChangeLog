2008.256:
	- Update libdali to 1.1.
	- Rework sendrecord() to include endtime for new API.

2008.196:
	- Update libdali to 1.0.

2008.115:
	- Add count of new bytes to diagnostic message when
	skipping a file until the next scan due to a bad read.

2008.109:
	- When miniSEED is not detected for a read from a file
	from which miniSEED was previously read keep the file in
	question during subsequent scans.  This should handle a
	race condition where attributes indicate a file has been
	modified but the new data is not available when reading.

2000.108:
	- Use the O_RSYNC flag when opening a file for reading
	under Solaris (other OSes do not support this flag).

2008.087:
	- Directory entries are processed in sorted order, add
	src/edir.[ch] which implement this sorting.

2008.077:
	- Update libdali to 0.9.4.

2008.075:
	- Remove redundant write error message.
	- Add shim function to print libdali messages via lprintf.

2008.074:
	- Update libdali to 0.9.2.

2008.059:
	- Add libdali to sources and use it to manage connection to
	ringserver.
	- Add -k option to specify keep alive interval.
	- Add -A option to require server acknowledgements.

2008.056:
	- Check for existence of base directory before starting the
	recursive scan and only log an error once per change if the
	directory cannot be found.

2008.052:
	- Update DataLink WRITE command syntax.

2008.051:
	- When writing state file first write to a temporary file and
	then move the temporary file into place, this avoids partial
	state file writes when the program is killed while writing.

2008.028:
	- Change DataLink synchronization bytes to 'DL'.

2008.017:
	- Add -sz option to sleep between scans only when no records
	were read during the previous scan.
	- Reorganize return codes to in processfile() so as to not
	return -1 when a system call has been interrupted and the stop
	signal is set.
	- Create man page for documentation.

2008.003:
	- Determine absolute path to state file to avoid writing state
	files in the recursed directories.
	- Allow the ringserver command line specification to assume
	"localhost" and port 16000 when they are not specified.
	- Do not log interrupted system call error messages when the
	shutdown signal is given.

2007.362:
	- Use pread(2) instead of read(2) and avoid an extra lseek(2).
	- Emit appropriate message when a record is detected with an
	unexpected record length and ignore the file afterwards.

2007.360:
	- Initial version based on mseedscan2orb 2007.261
	- Rework sending for DataLink protocol.
	- Add -1 option to quit after the first scan.
